    "section": "Key Valuation Definitions",
    "text": "Key Valuation Definitions\nBefore diving into the exit multiple method, we need to clarify some terms that are often confused (or at least I was confused about at some point). Understanding these distinctions is crucial for proper DCF valuation.\nWe must distinguish between Market-Observable Values and DCF Intrinsic Values. Market observable values are based on published data. For example:\n\nMarket Cap, which is defined as Share Price × Shares Outstanding. This is the total value the market assigns to all equity. Market Cap is the same as Equity Value when we’re talking about market prices. Important: this is NOT the same as Shareholder’s Equity from the balance sheet (which is book value based on historical accounting).\nNet Debt, defined as Total Debt - Cash & Cash Equivalents. This comes directly from the balance sheet and represents the company’s net financial obligations.\nEnterprise Value (EV), defined as Market Cap + Net Debt. This is the total value of the operating business; what you’d need to pay to own the entire company. Think of it like buying a house that already has a mortgage: you have to pay the house value (Market Cap) plus you take on the mortgage (Net Debt).\n\nOn the other hand, DCF intrinsic values are estimations calculated via DCF analysis, not market values:\n\nIntrinsic Enterprise Value, defined as PV of FCF (years 1-N) + PV of Terminal Value. This is what DCF calculates directly - the present value of all future cash flows from operations.\nIntrinsic Equity Value, defined as Intrinsic Enterprise Value - Estimated Net Debt, is what shareholders’ stake is actually worth after accounting for debt.\nIntrinsic Price per Share, defined as Intrinsic Equity Value / Shares Outstanding.\n\nA key insight is that, DCF estimates Enterprise Value. To get Equity Value (and price per share), we must subtract net debt. Skipping this step overestimates equity value for companies with significant debt. For simplicity in this post, we’ll follow the same approach as our previous posts and not adjust for net debt. We’ll address this refinement in a future post where we’ll enhance all three DCF variations."

    "section": "The Exit Multiple Method",
    "text": "The Exit Multiple Method\nThe exit multiple method answers a simple question: If I sell this business in N years, what will someone pay for it?. The answer depends on market multiples. When investors buy companies, they typically pay some multiple of the company’s financial metrics. For our purposes (and simplicity), we’ll use the EV/FCF multiple, i.e. how many times free cash flow the market values the enterprise at. Using FCF in the denominator allows us to easily integrate it into our DCF valuation method.\n\nCalculating Historical Multiples\nTo determine a reasonable exit multiple, we look at how the company has historically traded:\n\\[\n\\frac{EV}{FCF} = \\frac{Enterprise Value}{Free Cash Flow} = \\frac{Market Cap + Net Debt}{Free Cash Flow}\n\\] where market cap and net debt are both observable from market data and balance sheets.\nFor example: - Coca-Cola might historically trade at 25-35x FCF - A cyclical like LyondellBasell might trade at 8-15x FCF depending on the cycle - A high-growth company like Visa might trade at 25-30x FCF\nNote that we typically use a 5-10 year average to smooth out temporary fluctuations.\n\n\nThe Terminal Value Formula\nOnce we have our exit multiple, the terminal value calculation is straightforward:\n\\[\nTerminal Value = FCF_N \\cdot Exit Multiple\n\\]\nThis represents what we expect the enterprise to be worth at year N based on that year’s free cash flow and historical market multiples.\n\n\nKey Difference from Perpetuity Growth\nThe perpetuity method calculates:\n\\[\nTV = \\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{d - g_t}\n\\]\nNotice that the discount rate, \\(d\\), appears in the terminal value calculation itself, making it highly sensitive to your discount rate assumption. In contrast, the exit multiple method only uses the discount rate for timing, to calculate the present value of year N’s value.\nA critical insight is that the multiple itself already embeds the market’s assessment of growth, risk, and quality."

    "section": "When Discount Rate Matters",
    "text": "When Discount Rate Matters\nOne of the most striking differences between the two methods is how they respond to changes in the discount rate. The best way to see its effect is using an example. Let’s analyze Coca-Cola using different discount rates.\n\nThe Discount Rate Sensitivity\nConsider KO with these parameters: - FCFps_0 = $2.10 - FCF growth (gf) = 4% - Share buyback rate (gs) = -1% - Terminal growth (gt) = 3% - Exit multiple = 30x\nAt d = 5% (low discount rate):\n\nExit Multiple Method: $84.36\nPerpetuity Growth: $131.89\nPerpetuity values it 56% higher\n\nAt d = 10% (higher discount rate):\n\nExit Multiple Method: $56.20\nPerpetuity Growth: $36.33\nExit Multiple values it 55% higher\n\nNotice how the relative valuations completely flip! Why?\n\n\nThe Mathematical Explanation\nIn the perpetuity growth method, the discount rate appears in the terminal value formula itself (as part of the factor defining the geometric series):\n\\[TV = \\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{d - g_t}\\]\n\nWhen d = 5%: TV = FCF₁₁ / 0.02 = 50x FCF₁₁\n\nWhen d = 10%: TV = FCF₁₁ / 0.07 ≈ 14.3x FCF₁₁\n\nThe implied multiple changes dramatically with the discount rate!\nIn contrast, the exit multiple method uses a fixed multiple (30x in this case) regardless of the discount rate. The discount rate only affects the timing of bringing that future value back to today.\n\n\nWhat This Means\nThe exit multiple method essentially says: “The market has valued this company at 30x FCF historically, and I expect that to continue.”\nThe perpetuity method says: “Based on my assumptions about required return (d) and growth (gt), the company should be valued at \\(\\frac{1}{d-gt}\\) times FCF.”\nNeither is inherently “correct”, they’re just focusing on different aspects. Note that the multiple used in the exit multiple terminal valuation is a historical average defined by the market. Therefore, we can assume in includes many factors such as expected growth, business quality or deterioration, debt status, risks…"

If historical multiples are much higher (like KO’s 30x), the exit multiple method will give higher valuations.\nMarket Expectations Embedded: Exit multiples already embed the market’s collective assessment of growth, risk, quality, and competitive position.

Modeling these scenarios can help you estimate the range of potential outcomes when timing a “buy low, sell high” strategy."

    "section": "What is DCF Valuation?",
    "text": "What is DCF Valuation?\nThe basic idea behind the discounted cash flow model is that a company is as valuable as the cash it will generate over time. We could consider how much cash the company will generate indefinitely. However, no company lives forever, and forecasting becomes increasingly uncertain the further we look into the future. That’s why it is common to split this calculation into two components:\n\nProjected cash flows: Accumulate the expected future cash flows for a given number of years. It is common to take 10 years, but any other number is equally valid. Additionally, we should consider the stability and long-term perspective of the company, as well as how long we, as investors, plan to keep the company in our portfolio. Maybe a shorter period is suitable for certain companies, such as cyclicals.\nTerminal value: This represents the value of all cash flows the company will generate beyond our projection period. There are two main models here: perpetuity growth model, which captures the idea of holding the company forever, and exit multiple, which models closing the position at a certain valuation multiple.\n\nIn addition to all this, we must consider the time value of money. Cash flows generated in the future must be discounted to present value. For example, if we will receive 100 USD next year, and we use a discount rate (the return we expect to get from our investments) of 10%, the present value of those 100 USD is \\(100/(1+0.1) = 90.91\\). The reasoning behind this is that if we had 90.91 USD now, we could obtain those 100 USD next year if invested in an asset that would produce 10% returns. The concept of time value is fundamental in investment and discounting is how this model implements it."

    "section": "Terminal Value",
    "text": "Terminal Value\nThe second part of the DCF model is the terminal value. The DCF model makes several estimations for the first \\(N\\) years. However, after that period any estimation for cash flows, growth or discount rate is very uncertain. In order to address this it is common to estimate a terminal value that represents the cash to be made after that point in time. There are two main methods to estimate this:\n\nPerpetuity growth method: Estimate cash flows after year \\(N\\) in a conservative way and apply discounting.\nExit multiple method: Estimate the future price of the company based on some multiple of its metrics (e.g. 15x FCF) and treat it as if you would sell it.\n\nIn this post we will focus on the perpetuity growth model, which is more suitable for high quality companies with durable competitive advantages.\n\nTerminal Value from Perpetuity Growth\nThe perpetuity growth method estimates how much free cash flows the company will generate from year \\(N\\) until the end of times. In order to conservatively model this we assume a moderate perpetual growth rate, \\(g\\), for example 2-3%. The calculations look very similar to the previous ones:\n\\[FCF_{N+2} = FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)\\]\n\\[FCF_{N+1+n} = FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)^n\\]\nThese are all future values. We must apply discounting to obtain the corresponding present value:\n\\[PV(FCF_{N+1+n}) = \\frac{FCF_{N+1+n}}{(1+d)^n} = \\frac{FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)^n}{(1+d)^n}\\]\nFinally, the terminal value is then the aggregate of all future cash flows discounted to year \\(N\\):\n\\[TV = \\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{(1+d)} + \\frac{FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)}{(1+d)^2} + ... = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)^{n-1}}{(1+d)^{n}}\\]\nThese calculations result in a geometric series.\n\n\nGeometric Series Simplification\nThe equation above defines a geometric series. A geometric series is a summation in which each element is obtained by multiplying the previous element by a constant factor:\n\\[a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3+...=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}ar^n\\]\nA fundamental property of geometric series is that the sum converges only if \\(|r| &lt; 1\\) and it converges to a value \\(S = \\frac{a}{1-r}\\).\nNote that we can map our terminal value series to this geometric series with \\(a=\\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{1+d}\\) and \\(r=\\frac{1+g}{1+d}\\). From this it is clear that this method of computing the terminal value is only valid if the discount rate is larger than the perpetual growth rate. This is rather obvious if you think about it. A company that grows at a rate larger than the discount rate would be worth infinite!\nThe result of the geometric series is then:\n\\[TV = \\frac{a}{1-r} = \\frac{\\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{1+d}}{1-\\frac{1+g}{1+d}}\\]\nThe denominator can be simplified:\n\\[1-\\frac{1+g}{1+d} = \\frac{1+d-1-g}{1+d} = \\frac{d-g}{1+d}\\]\nAnd the final terminal value results in:\n\\[TV = \\frac{\\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{1+d}}{\\frac{d-g}{1+d}} = FCF_{N+1} \\frac{1+d}{(1+d)(d-g)} = \\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{d-g}\\]"

    "section": "Applying the Model to Real Companies",
    "text": "Applying the Model to Real Companies\nNow that we have a working DCF model, let’s apply it to some real companies to see what valuations we get. We will analyze three different companies with varying characteristics:\n\nCoca-Cola (KO): A classic quality company with strong brand moat and stable cash flows\nMondelez (MDLZ): Another consumer staples company in the food/snacks sector\nLyondellBasell (LYB): A cyclical chemicals company to show how the model handles volatility\n\nFor each company, we will use current financial data and make reasonable assumptions about growth rates and discount rates based on their business characteristics.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\nCompany Overview: Who doesn’t know Coca-Cola? Coca-cola is a global beverage leader with one of the strongest brand portfolios in the world.\nFinancial Data:\n\nCurrent FCF: 4,741 million\nShares Outstanding: 4,309 million\nCurrent Stock Price: ~$73\n\nModel Assumptions:\n\nGrowth Rate (r): 4% - Quite conservative growth reflecting mature market but international expansion opportunities\nDiscount Rate (d): 5% - Low rate reflecting stable cash flows and strong competitive moat. It is probably unrealistic to ask much higher returns from such a company\nPerpetual Growth (g): 3% - Again quite conservative\nProjection Period: 10 years - Standard projection range\n\nValuation Result: $62.43 per share\nAnalysis: The model suggests KO is currently trading about 17% above its fair value at $73. However, not long ago the stock was trading around $58, which would have represented an undervaluation according to this model. This demonstrates that quality companies do occasionally trade at or below fair value, though they typically command a premium due to their stability and moat. It is also true that the obtained return is not extraordinary, but good enough to give stability to a portfolio.\n\n\nMondelez International (MDLZ)\nCompany Overview: Mondelez is a global snacking powerhouse. It owns many iconic brands like Oreo or Toblerone. Again, great brand power but I would say not at the level of Coca-Cola.\nFinancial Data:\n\nCurrent FCF: 3,523 million\nShares Outstanding: 1,347 million\nCurrent Stock Price: ~$60\n\nModel Assumptions:\n\nGrowth Rate (r): 4.5% - Slightly higher than KO, reflecting growth in emerging markets and snacking trends\nDiscount Rate (d): 5.5% - Slightly higher than KO due to more competitive snacking category\nPerpetual Growth (g): 3% - Standard conservative value\nProjection Period: 10 years - Standard range\n\nValuation Result: $124.22 per share\nAnalysis: Interestingly, the model suggests MDLZ is significantly undervalued at its current price of ~$60, trading at roughly half its estimated fair value. This large gap could indicate either that our assumptions are too optimistic, or that the market is undervaluing MDLZ’s cash generation potential. Recent developments in the health/medical domain, such as Ozempic, may affect future sales according to some analysts. However, the snacking category seems to have strong tailwinds, so growth could be even larger. We shall see how this valuation fares once we start adding complexity to the analysis methodology. Maybe the FCF estimation is too enthusiastic?\n\n\nLyondellBasell Industries (LYB)\nCompany Overview: LyondellBasell is one of the world’s largest plastics, chemicals, and refining companies. As a cyclical business, its cash flows can swing enormously.\nFinancial Data:\n\nCurrent FCF: 1,980 million\nShares Outstanding: 324 million\nCurrent Stock Price: ~$44.80\n\nModel Assumptions:\n\nGrowth Rate (r): 3% - Conservative, reflecting cyclical nature and mature industry\nDiscount Rate (d): 12% - Higher rate reflecting cyclicality, commodity price risk, and the higher returns expected from riskier investments\nPerpetual Growth (g): 2% - Very conservative for cyclical business\nProjection Period: 10 years - Standard range\n\nValuation Result: $66.91 per share\nAnalysis: The model suggests LYB is moderately undervalued at $44.80, trading at about 67% of its estimated fair value. However, this analysis highlights important limitations. The perpetuity growth method may not be the most suitable one to compute the terminal value. Personally, I would not hold a cyclical company forever - I typically invest in them during the low part of the cycle and sell during peaks. For this investment strategy, the exit multiple method would be more appropriate for estimating terminal value, as it better reflects the reality of eventually selling the position rather than holding indefinitely."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWe’ve built a complete DCF valuation model from first principles, implementing the perpetuity growth method to estimate terminal value. Applying this model to three different companies revealed some interesting insights:\n\nQuality companies like KO can occasionally trade near fair value, though they often command a premium for their stability\nMDLZ appears significantly undervalued by this model, suggesting either overly optimistic assumptions or genuine market undervaluation\nCyclical companies like LYB present challenges for perpetuity-based models, as current FCF may not represent normalized earnings\n\nThe model produces reasonable valuations when we use appropriate discount rates that reflect each company’s risk profile. However, we’ve identified a significant limitation: we haven’t accounted for share buybacks, which many quality companies use aggressively to return value to shareholders.\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIn the next post, we’ll enhance this model by incorporating share buybacks. When companies reduce their share count over time, FCF per share grows faster than the overall FCF growth rate. This adjustment often brings valuations much closer to market prices for companies that consistently buy back shares.\nStay tuned for Part 2: Adding Share Buybacks to the DCF Model!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the previous post, we explored the fundamentals of DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) valuation. We learned how to project future cash flows, discount them to present value, and calculate a terminal value using the perpetuity growth method.\nHowever, we identified an important limitation: the basic DCF model does not account for changes in share count over time. For companies that aggressively buy back their own shares, this can lead to significantly underestimated fair values. We will see that later.\nIn this post, we will extend our DCF model to incorporate the effect of share buybacks (and conversely, share issuance). We will see how this adjustment can make a meaningful difference in valuation. Sometimes over 25%!\n\n\nWhen a company buys back its own shares, something interesting happens: the total free cash flow might stay the same (or grow at its usual rate), but that cash flow is now divided among fewer shares.\nThis means that FCF per share grows faster than total FCF.\nFor example, imagine a company with:\n\nTotal FCF: $100 million\nShares outstanding: 10 million\nFCF per share: $10\n\nLet’s imagine that the company buys back 10% of its shares (1 million shares) and the total FCF stays the same. We would have:\n\nTotal FCF: still $100 million (assuming no growth)\nShares outstanding: 9 million\nFCF per share: $11.11\n\nNote that the FCF per share has increased by 11%. That’s a significant increase! Even though total FCF didn’t grow at all!!\nThe basic DCF model misses this effect entirely because it divides total enterprise value by the current share count, ignoring future buybacks.\n\n\n\nTo incorporate buybacks into our DCF model, we need to project FCF per share rather than total FCF.\nLet’s start with how we typically project total FCF:\n\\[FCF_{i+1} = FCF_i \\cdot (1 + g_f)\\]\nwhere \\(g_f\\) is the growth rate for free cash flow.\nSimilarly, we can project the number of shares:\n\\[s_{i+1} = s_i \\cdot (1 + g_s)\\]\nwhere \\(g_s\\) is the growth rate for shares outstanding. Note that \\(g_s\\) is negative when there are buybacks and positive when shares are issued.\nNow, FCF per share in year \\(i+1\\) is:\n\\[FCFps_{i+1} = \\frac{FCF_{i+1}}{s_{i+1}} = \\frac{FCF_i \\cdot (1 + g_f)}{s_i \\cdot (1 + g_s)} = FCFps_i \\cdot \\frac{1 + g_f}{1 + g_s}\\]\nThis gives us an effective growth rate for FCF per share:\n\\[g_{eff} = \\frac{1 + g_f}{1 + g_s} - 1\\]\nFor example, with 5% FCF growth and -3% share reduction (buybacks):\n\\[g_{eff} = \\frac{1.05}{0.97} - 1 = 0.0825 \\text{ or } 8.25\\%\\]\nThe buybacks amplify the growth rate from 5% to 8.25%!\n\n\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the functionality required to build a DCF-based valuation that takes into account buybacks. First, we need a function to compute the effective growth rate:\ndef compute_effective_growth_rate(gf: float, gs: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\" Compute effective growth rate for FCF per share.\n    Args:\n        gf: Growth rate for free cash flow (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)\n        gs: Growth rate for shares outstanding (negative for buybacks, e.g., -0.03 for 3% reduction)\n\n    Returns:\n        Effective growth rate for FCF per share\n    \"\"\"\n    return (1 + gf) / (1 + gs) - 1\nNow we can modify our DCF valuation function (builds on top of the methods implemented in the previous post) to work with FCF per share and the effective growth rate:\ndef dcf_valuation_with_buybacks(FCFps_0: float, gf: float, gs: float, d: float, gt: float, N: int = 10) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute DCF valuation per share accounting for buybacks/share issuance.\n    \n    Args:\n        FCFps_0: Current free cash flow per share\n        gf: Growth rate for total free cash flow (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)\n        gs: Growth rate for shares outstanding (negative for buybacks, e.g., -0.03 for 3% reduction)\n        d: Discount rate (e.g., 0.10 for 10%)\n        gt: Terminal growth rate for perpetuity calculation (e.g., 0.03 for 3%)\n        N: Number of years to project explicitly (default: 10)\n    \n    Returns:\n        Estimated fair value per share\n    \"\"\"\n    geff = compute_effective_growth_rate(gf, gs)\n    pvs = [present_value(estimate_future_FCF(FCFps_0, geff, i+1), d, i+1) for i in range(N)]\n    PV = sum(pvs)\n    TV = present_value(terminal_value(estimate_future_FCF(FCFps_0, geff, N+1), d, gt), d, N)\n    return (PV + TV)\nThe key insight is that once we have \\(g_{eff}\\), we can reuse our existing helper functions (estimate_future_FCF, present_value, terminal_value) — we just pass in FCF per share instead of total FCF!\n\n\n\nLet’s apply our enhanced DCF model to three well-known companies with active buyback programs: Apple (AAPL), Visa (V), and McDonald’s (MCD).\nFor each company, we’ll compare the valuation with and without accounting for buybacks.\n\n\nParameters:\n\nCurrent FCF: $109,000 million\nShares outstanding: 15,400 million\nFCF per share: $7.08\nFCF growth rate (gf): 5%\nShare growth rate (gs): -3% (buybacks)\nDiscount rate: 10%\nTerminal growth rate: 3%\n\nResults:\n\nDCF without buybacks: $121.97 per share\nDCF with buybacks: $158.08 per share\nCurrent market price: $278.85\nImpact of buybacks: +29.6%\n\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\nCurrent FCF: $18,700 million\nShares outstanding: 2,030 million\nFCF per share: $9.21\nFCF growth rate (gf): 7%\nShare growth rate (gs): -2.5% (buybacks)\nDiscount rate: 10%\nTerminal growth rate: 3%\n\nResults:\n\nDCF without buybacks: $186.16 per share\nDCF with buybacks: $232.03 per share\nCurrent market price: $334.44\nImpact of buybacks: +24.6%\n\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\nCurrent FCF: $6,670 million\nShares outstanding: 722 million\nFCF per share: $9.24\nFCF growth rate (gf): 7%\nShare growth rate (gs): -1% (buybacks)\nDiscount rate: 10%\nTerminal growth rate: 3%\n\nResults:\n\nDCF without buybacks: $186.70 per share\nDCF with buybacks: $203.57 per share\nCurrent market price: $312.40\nImpact of buybacks: +9.0%\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of buybacks varies significantly:\n\nApple shows the largest effect (29.6%) due to its aggressive 3% annual buyback rate\nVisa is close behind (24.6%) with a 2.5% buyback rate\nMcDonald’s shows a smaller but still meaningful effect (9.0%) with a 1% buyback rate\n\nEven with buyback adjustments, all three companies appear overvalued compared to their DCF estimates. This is common for high-quality companies. The cause might be market overvaluation. But it could be that this valuation method is not suitable. In future post I will investigate this from a historical perspective. This is, given this valuation model, were these companies ever fairly priced? I would expect to see this only in market crashes, but we wille explore it in more detail in future posts.\n\n\n\n\nIn this post, we extended the basic DCF valuation model to account for share buybacks and issuance. Here are the main points:\n\nBuybacks amplify per-share growth: When companies buy back shares, FCF per share grows faster than total FCF, even if the business itself isn’t growing faster.\nThe math is elegant: We can compute an effective growth rate \\(g_{eff} = \\frac{1+g_f}{1+g_s} - 1\\) that captures both FCF growth and share count changes.\nThe impact is significant: In our examples, accounting for buybacks increased valuations by 9-30%, depending on the buyback rate.\nImplementation is straightforward: Once we have the effective growth rate, we can reuse our existing DCF machinery: just work with FCF per share instead of total FCF.\nValuation puzzles remain: Even with buyback adjustments, high-quality companies often trade above DCF estimates. This raises interesting questions about market pricing and model assumptions.\n\n\n\nSeveral questions emerge from this analysis:\n\nHistorical perspective: Are quality companies always “expensive” by DCF standards, or do they periodically reach fair value during market downturns?\nCyclical businesses: DCF valuation is usually applied to high-quality business with durable competitive advantages where FCF projections can be made with some certainty. Can it be applied to other businesses with more volatile free cash flows?\nSensitivity analysis: Which parameters (discount rate, growth rates, terminal value) have the biggest impact on our valuations?\n\nWe’ll explore these topics in future posts."

Here are the main points:\n\nBuybacks amplify per-share growth: When companies buy back shares, FCF per share grows faster than total FCF, even if the business itself isn’t growing faster.\nThe math is elegant: We can compute an effective growth rate \\(g_{eff} = \\frac{1+g_f}{1+g_s} - 1\\) that captures both FCF growth and share count changes.\nThe impact is significant: In our examples, accounting for buybacks increased valuations by 9-30%, depending on the buyback rate.\nImplementation is straightforward: Once we have the effective growth rate, we can reuse our existing DCF machinery: just work with FCF per share instead of total FCF.\nValuation puzzles remain: Even with buyback adjustments, high-quality companies often trade above DCF estimates. This raises interesting questions about market pricing and model assumptions.\n\n\n\nSeveral questions emerge from this analysis:\n\nHistorical perspective: Are quality companies always “expensive” by DCF standards, or do they periodically reach fair value during market downturns?\nCyclical businesses: DCF valuation is usually applied to high-quality business with durable competitive advantages where FCF projections can be made with some certainty. Can it be applied to other businesses with more volatile free cash flows?\nSensitivity analysis: Which parameters (discount rate, growth rates, terminal value) have the biggest impact on our valuations?\n\nWe’ll explore these topics in future posts."

    "text": "I am working toward financial independence through dividend investing. My goal is to build a portfolio that provides the freedom to choose how I spend my time, without the constant pressure of relying solely on my job to provide for my family.\nMy approach is straightforward: I study companies carefully, perform my own valuations, and only buy when there is a good margin of safety. Price is one of the pillars to achieve strong returns. I focus on dividend-paying stocks because they provide peace of mind through periodic income while I build ownership in quality businesses. Warren Buffett’s philosophy resonates strongly with me.\nThis blog is where I share my journey as I learn and grow as an investor. I hope to publish company analyses, valuation models, portfolio movements and reflections on what I am discovering along the way. I am a beginner at sharing publicly, but I believe documenting the process will help both me and others on a similar path."
