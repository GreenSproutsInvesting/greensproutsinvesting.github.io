    "text": "When valuing quality companies like Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble, I often find that my DCF models return surprisingly conservative target prices, quite often well below current market prices. Is my valuation method flawed, or are these companies simply overvalued?\nIn this post, we’ll walk through the fundamentals of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation, including how to properly account for terminal value using the perpetuity growth method. We’ll implement the model step-by-step in Python and apply it to several real companies to see what the model returns.\nThis is the first in a series of posts exploring DCF valuation. In future posts, we’ll refine the model by incorporating share buybacks and conduct a historical analysis to identify when quality companies have actually traded at fair value."

    "text": "What is DCF Valuation?\nThe basic idea behind the discounted cash flow model is that a company is as valuable as the cash it will generate over time. We could consider how much cash the company will generate indefinitely. However, no company lives forever, and forecasting becomes increasingly uncertain the further we look into the future. That’s why it is common to split this calculation into two components:\n\nProjected cash flows: Accumulate the expected future cash flows for a given number of years. It is common to take 10 years, but any other number is equally valid. Additionally, we should consider the stability and long-term perspective of the company, as well as how long we, as investors, plan to keep the company in our portfolio. Maybe a shorter period is suitable for certain companies, such as cyclicals.\nTerminal value: This represents the value of all cash flows the company will generate beyond our projection period. There are two main models here: perpetuity growth model, which captures the idea of holding the company forever, and exit multiple, which models closing the position at a certain valuation multiple.\n\nIn addition to all this, we must consider the time value of money. Cash flows generated in the future must be discounted to present value. For example, if we will receive 100 USD next year, and we use a discount rate (the return we expect to get from our investments) of 10%, the present value of those 100 USD is \\(100/(1+0.1) = 90.91\\). The reasoning behind this is that if we had 90.91 USD now, we could obtain those 100 USD next year if invested in an asset that would produce 10% returns. The concept of time value is fundamental in investment and discounting is how this model implements it."

I think about it as the opportunity cost. If we had the cash today, we could invest it and earn returns. We use a discount rate to convert future cash flows to their present value.\nThe present value, \\(PV\\), of some future value \\(FV\\) one year from now is obtained as:\n\\[PV = \\frac{FV}{(1+d)}\\]\nLooking further into the future, for year \\(n\\):\n\\[PV = \\frac{FV_n}{(1+d)^n}\\]\nWhere \\(d\\) is the discount rate, representing our required rate of return or opportunity cost."

    "section": "Terminal Value",
    "text": "Terminal Value\nThe second part of the DCF model is the terminal value. The DCF model makes several estimations for the first \\(N\\) years. However, after that period any estimation for cash flows, growth or discount rate is very uncertain. In order to address this it is common to estimate a terminal value that represents the cash to be made after that point in time. There are two main methods to estimate this:\n\nPerpetuity growth method: Estimate cash flows after year \\(N\\) in a conservative way and apply discounting.\nExit multiple method: Estimate the future price of the company based on some multiple of its metrics (e.g. 15x FCF) and treat it as if you would sell it.\n\nIn this post we will focus on the perpetuity growth model, which is more suitable for high quality companies with durable competitive advantages.\n\nTerminal Value from Perpetuity Growth\nThe perpetuity growth method estimates how much free cash flows the company will generate from year \\(N\\) until the end of times. In order to conservatively model this we assume a moderate perpetual growth rate, \\(g\\), for example 2-3%. The calculations look very similar to the previous ones:\n\\[FCF_{N+2} = FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)\\]\n\\[FCF_{N+1+n} = FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)^n\\]\nThese are all future values. We must apply discounting to obtain the corresponding present value:\n\\[PV(FCF_{N+1+n}) = \\frac{FCF_{N+1+n}}{(1+d)^n} = \\frac{FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)^n}{(1+d)^n}\\]\nFinally, the terminal value is then the aggregate of all future cash flows discounted to year \\(N\\):\n\\[TV = \\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{(1+d)} + \\frac{FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)}{(1+d)^2} + ... = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{FCF_{N+1} \\cdot (1+g)^{n-1}}{(1+d)^{n}}\\]\nThese calculations result in a geometric series.\n\n\nGeometric Series Simplification\nThe equation above defines a geometric series. A geometric series is a summation in which each element is obtained by multiplying the previous element by a constant factor:\n\\[a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3+...=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}ar^n\\]\nA fundamental property of geometric series is that the sum converges only if \\(|r| &lt; 1\\) and it converges to a value \\(S = \\frac{a}{1-r}\\).\nNote that we can map our terminal value series to this geometric series with \\(a=\\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{1+d}\\) and \\(r=\\frac{1+g}{1+d}\\). From this it is clear that this method of computing the terminal value is only valid if the discount rate is larger than the perpetual growth rate. This is rather obvious if you think about it. A company that grows at a rate larger than the discount rate would be worth infinite!\nThe result of the geometric series is then:\n\\[TV = \\frac{a}{1-r} = \\frac{\\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{1+d}}{1-\\frac{1+g}{1+d}}\\]\nThe denominator can be simplified:\n\\[1-\\frac{1+g}{1+d} = \\frac{1+d-1-g}{1+d} = \\frac{d-g}{1+d}\\]\nAnd the final terminal value results in:\n\\[TV = \\frac{\\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{1+d}}{\\frac{d-g}{1+d}} = FCF_{N+1} \\frac{1+d}{(1+d)(d-g)} = \\frac{FCF_{N+1}}{d-g}\\]"

    "section": "Applying the Model to Real Companies",
    "text": "Applying the Model to Real Companies\nNow that we have a working DCF model, let’s apply it to some real companies to see what valuations we get. We will analyze three different companies with varying characteristics:\n\nCoca-Cola (KO): A classic quality company with strong brand moat and stable cash flows\nMondelez (MDLZ): Another consumer staples company in the food/snacks sector\nLyondellBasell (LYB): A cyclical chemicals company to show how the model handles volatility\n\nFor each company, we will use current financial data and make reasonable assumptions about growth rates and discount rates based on their business characteristics.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\nCompany Overview: Who doesn’t know Coca-Cola? Coca-cola is a global beverage leader with one of the strongest brand portfolios in the world.\nFinancial Data:\n\nCurrent FCF: 4,741 million\nShares Outstanding: 4,309 million\nCurrent Stock Price: ~$73\n\nModel Assumptions:\n\nGrowth Rate (r): 4% - Quite conservative growth reflecting mature market but international expansion opportunities\nDiscount Rate (d): 5% - Low rate reflecting stable cash flows and strong competitive moat. It is probably unrealistic to ask much higher returns from such a company\nPerpetual Growth (g): 3% - Again quite conservative\nProjection Period: 10 years - Standard projection range\n\nValuation Result: $62.43 per share\nAnalysis: The model suggests KO is currently trading about 17% above its fair value at $73. However, not long ago the stock was trading around $58, which would have represented an undervaluation according to this model. This demonstrates that quality companies do occasionally trade at or below fair value, though they typically command a premium due to their stability and moat. It is also true that the obtained return is not extraordinary, but good enough to give stability to a portfolio.\n\n\nMondelez International (MDLZ)\nCompany Overview: Mondelez is a global snacking powerhouse. It owns many iconic brands like Oreo or Toblerone. Again, great brand power but I would say not at the level of Coca-Cola.\nFinancial Data:\n\nCurrent FCF: 3,523 million\nShares Outstanding: 1,347 million\nCurrent Stock Price: ~$60\n\nModel Assumptions:\n\nGrowth Rate (r): 4.5% - Slightly higher than KO, reflecting growth in emerging markets and snacking trends\nDiscount Rate (d): 5.5% - Slightly higher than KO due to more competitive snacking category\nPerpetual Growth (g): 3% - Standard conservative value\nProjection Period: 10 years - Standard range\n\nValuation Result: $124.22 per share\nAnalysis: Interestingly, the model suggests MDLZ is significantly undervalued at its current price of ~$60, trading at roughly half its estimated fair value. This large gap could indicate either that our assumptions are too optimistic, or that the market is undervaluing MDLZ’s cash generation potential. Recent developments in the health/medical domain, such as Ozempic, may affect future sales according to some analysts. However, the snacking category seems to have strong tailwinds, so growth could be even larger. We shall see how this valuation fares once we start adding complexity to the analysis methodology. Maybe the FCF estimation is too enthusiastic?\n\n\nLyondellBasell Industries (LYB)\nCompany Overview: LyondellBasell is one of the world’s largest plastics, chemicals, and refining companies. As a cyclical business, its cash flows can swing enormously.\nFinancial Data:\n\nCurrent FCF: 1,980 million\nShares Outstanding: 324 million\nCurrent Stock Price: ~$44.80\n\nModel Assumptions:\n\nGrowth Rate (r): 3% - Conservative, reflecting cyclical nature and mature industry\nDiscount Rate (d): 12% - Higher rate reflecting cyclicality, commodity price risk, and the higher returns expected from riskier investments\nPerpetual Growth (g): 2% - Very conservative for cyclical business\nProjection Period: 10 years - Standard range\n\nValuation Result: $66.91 per share\nAnalysis: The model suggests LYB is moderately undervalued at $44.80, trading at about 67% of its estimated fair value. However, this analysis highlights important limitations. The perpetuity growth method may not be the most suitable one to compute the terminal value. Personally, I would not hold a cyclical company forever - I typically invest in them during the low part of the cycle and sell during peaks. For this investment strategy, the exit multiple method would be more appropriate for estimating terminal value, as it better reflects the reality of eventually selling the position rather than holding indefinitely."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWe’ve built a complete DCF valuation model from first principles, implementing the perpetuity growth method to estimate terminal value. Applying this model to three different companies revealed some interesting insights:\n\nQuality companies like KO can occasionally trade near fair value, though they often command a premium for their stability\nMDLZ appears significantly undervalued by this model, suggesting either overly optimistic assumptions or genuine market undervaluation\nCyclical companies like LYB present challenges for perpetuity-based models, as current FCF may not represent normalized earnings\n\nThe model produces reasonable valuations when we use appropriate discount rates that reflect each company’s risk profile. However, we’ve identified a significant limitation: we haven’t accounted for share buybacks, which many quality companies use aggressively to return value to shareholders.\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIn the next post, we’ll enhance this model by incorporating share buybacks. When companies reduce their share count over time, FCF per share grows faster than the overall FCF growth rate. This adjustment often brings valuations much closer to market prices for companies that consistently buy back shares.\nStay tuned for Part 2: Adding Share Buybacks to the DCF Model!"
