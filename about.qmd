I am working toward financial independence through dividend investing.
My goal is to build a portfolio that provides the freedom to choose how I spend my time, without the constant pressure of relying solely on my job to provide for my family.

My approach is straightforward: I study companies carefully, perform my own valuations, and only buy when there is a good margin of safety.
Price is one of the pillars to achieve strong returns.
I focus on dividend-paying stocks because they provide peace of mind through periodic income while I build ownership in quality businesses.
Warren Buffett's philosophy resonates strongly with me.

This blog is where I share my journey as I learn and grow as an investor.
I hope to publish company analyses, valuation models, portfolio movements and reflections on what I am discovering along the way.
I am a beginner at sharing publicly, but I believe documenting the process will help both me and others on a similar path.
